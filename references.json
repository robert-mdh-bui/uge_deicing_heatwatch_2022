  {"id":"noaaClimateNormals2021","abstract":"The U.S. Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide information about typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. Normals act both as a ruler to compare today’s weather and tomorrow’s forecast, and as a predictor of conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather stations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"NOAA","given":""}],"citation-key":"noaaClimateNormals2021","container-title":"National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"language":"en","title":"U.S. Climate Normals","type":"webpage","URL":"http://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/us-climate-normals"},
