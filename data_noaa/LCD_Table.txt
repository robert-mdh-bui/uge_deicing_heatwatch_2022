WBAN_ID             5 	    99999        001-005    Assigned by NCEI, used for digital data storage and general station 
                                                    identification purposes.

TRANSMITTAL_ID      10      X(10)        007-016    Usually this is the official ICAO identifier, used for geographical locations
